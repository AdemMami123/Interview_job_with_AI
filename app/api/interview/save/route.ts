INTERVIEW DETAILS:
- Role: ${role}
- Level: ${level}
- Original Tech Stack: ${techstack?.join(', ') || 'General'}
- Duration: ${duration} minutes

TRANSCRIPT:
${transcript.map((msg: any) => `${msg.role === 'user' ? 'Candidate' : 'Interviewer'}: ${msg.content}`).join('\n')}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. CONVERSATIONAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Analyze the actual conversation flow and candidate responses:

   Technical Knowledge (40% weight):
   - 90-100: Expert-level responses with deep understanding, accurate technical details, advanced concepts explained clearly
   - 80-89: Strong technical foundation, mostly accurate information, good grasp of core concepts
   - 70-79: Adequate understanding with minor gaps, generally sound but needs more depth
   - 60-69: Basic knowledge with notable gaps, some inaccuracies or overly vague responses
   - 50-59: Limited understanding, significant errors or confusion evident
   - Below 50: Major technical deficiencies, fundamentally incorrect information

   Communication Skills (25% weight):
   - 90-100: Exceptionally articulate, clear explanations, great conversational flow
   - 80-89: Clear and well-organized communication, easy to follow
   - 70-79: Generally clear with minor issues in organization or clarity
   - 60-69: Somewhat unclear, lacks structure, difficult to follow at times
   - 50-59: Poor communication, very unclear or disorganized responses
   - Below 50: Incoherent or extremely difficult to understand

   Problem Solving (25% weight):
   - 90-100: Systematic approach, excellent logical reasoning, considers multiple solutions
   - 80-89: Good problem-solving methodology, reasonable logical thinking
   - 70-79: Basic problem-solving skills with some logical structure
   - 60-69: Limited problem-solving ability, struggles with systematic thinking
   - 50-59: Poor logical reasoning, confused approach to problems
   - Below 50: No clear problem-solving methodology demonstrated

   Engagement & Professionalism (10% weight):
   - 90-100: Highly engaged, asks thoughtful questions, demonstrates genuine interest
   - 80-89: Good engagement level, professional demeanor, appropriate responses
   - 70-79: Adequate engagement, some missed opportunities for deeper interaction
   - 60-69: Limited engagement, minimal interaction beyond basic answers
   - 50-59: Poor engagement, appears disinterested or unprofessional
   - Below 50: Very poor engagement, concerning professional behavior

2. EVIDENCE-BASED SCORING: Each score must be justified by specific examples from the conversation:
   - Quote specific responses that demonstrate competency levels
   - Note conversation patterns that indicate engagement and understanding
   - Identify missed opportunities or areas where responses fell short
   - Consider the natural flow and authenticity of the conversation
3. CONVERSATIONAL FLOW ANALYSIS: Evaluate the natural flow and quality of the conversation:
   - How well did the candidate engage with follow-up questions?
   - Did they provide specific examples when asked?
   - Were they able to elaborate on technical topics naturally?
   - Did they ask thoughtful questions about the role or company?
   - How did they handle unexpected or challenging questions?

4. CONTEXTUAL NAMING: Generate a highly specific, descriptive interview name based on the ACTUAL conversation content:
   - Analyze what topics were genuinely discussed during the interview
   - Focus on specific technical areas, challenges, or insights that emerged
   - Include technologies and concepts that were actually explored in depth
   - Make it descriptive of the actual conversation experience
   - Examples: "React Component Architecture & Performance Discussion", "Backend API Design & Database Strategies", "Full-Stack Development & Security Best Practices", "Frontend State Management & User Experience", "System Design & Scalability Approaches"
   - If the conversation was more general: "Software Development Experience & Problem-Solving", "Technical Foundation & Career Aspirations"

5. TECHNOLOGY EXTRACTION: Extract ALL technologies that were actually discussed or mentioned:
   - Only include technologies that came up naturally in conversation
   - Include programming languages, frameworks, tools, databases, concepts
   - If the candidate demonstrated knowledge through examples or explanations
   - DO NOT include technologies from the original stack unless actually discussed

6. EVIDENCE-BASED FEEDBACK: Provide specific examples from the conversation to support scores:
   - Quote specific responses that demonstrate strengths or weaknesses
   - Reference particular moments that influenced the assessment
   - Mention conversation patterns that indicate skill level

CRITICAL ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES:
1. EVIDENCE-BASED SCORING: Every score must be justified by specific conversation examples
   - Quote specific responses that demonstrate competency levels
   - Reference particular moments that influenced the assessment
   - Note patterns in their responses (consistency, depth, clarity)

2. CONVERSATION QUALITY INDICATORS:
   - Did they provide specific examples when asked?
   - How did they handle follow-up questions?
   - Were they able to explain complex topics clearly?
   - Did they ask thoughtful questions about the role or company?
   - How engaged were they throughout the conversation?

3. REALISTIC SCORING STANDARDS:
   - 85-100: Exceptional performance with clear expertise and excellent communication
   - 70-84: Good performance showing solid understanding and clear communication
   - 60-69: Average performance with basic understanding but some gaps
   - 50-59: Below average with significant gaps or unclear communication
   - Below 50: Poor performance with major deficiencies

4. INTERVIEW NAME REQUIREMENTS: 
   - Must reflect actual conversation topics, not just job title
   - Should be descriptive enough that someone reading it understands what was covered
   - Examples: "React State Management & Performance Discussion", "Backend API Design & Database Strategies"
   - Avoid generic titles like "Frontend Developer Interview"

5. CONVERSATION CONTEXT: Consider the natural flow and quality of the discussion:
   - Was it a productive technical conversation?
   - Did the candidate demonstrate genuine knowledge through their responses?
   - How well did they articulate their thoughts and experiences?

IMPORTANT: Base all assessments strictly on actual conversation quality and demonstrated competence. Be honest about performance - not every interview should score highly. Use the full scoring range appropriately.
