ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. LOGICAL SCORING FRAMEWORK: Evaluate each response systematically and assign scores based on measurable criteria:

   Technical Knowledge (40% weight):
   - 90-100: Demonstrates expert understanding, uses correct terminology, explains complex concepts clearly
   - 80-89: Shows solid technical foundation, mostly accurate information, good grasp of fundamentals
   - 70-79: Basic understanding evident, some gaps or unclear explanations, needs more depth
   - 60-69: Limited technical knowledge, several inaccuracies or vague responses
   - 50-59: Poor technical understanding, mostly incorrect or confused responses
   - Below 50: Major technical gaps, fundamentally incorrect answers

   Communication Skills (25% weight):
   - 90-100: Exceptionally clear, well-structured responses, excellent articulation
   - 80-89: Clear communication, good structure, easy to follow
   - 70-79: Generally clear with some organizational issues or minor unclear points
   - 60-69: Somewhat unclear, lacks structure, difficult to follow at times
   - 50-59: Poor communication, very unclear or disorganized responses
   - Below 50: Incoherent or extremely difficult to understand

   Problem Solving (25% weight):
   - 90-100: Systematic approach, breaks down problems logically, considers multiple solutions
   - 80-89: Good logical thinking, reasonable problem-solving approach
   - 70-79: Basic problem-solving skills, sometimes lacks systematic approach
   - 60-69: Limited problem-solving ability, struggles with logical reasoning
   - 50-59: Poor problem-solving approach, illogical or confused thinking
   - Below 50: No clear problem-solving ability demonstrated

   Experience & Examples (10% weight):
   - 90-100: Rich, detailed real-world examples that clearly demonstrate competence
   - 80-89: Good practical examples with adequate detail
   - 70-79: Some relevant examples but lacking detail or clarity
   - 60-69: Few or weak examples, limited practical experience shown
   - 50-59: Poor or irrelevant examples
   - Below 50: No meaningful examples provided

   Total Score Calculation: (Technical × 0.4) + (Communication × 0.25) + (Problem Solving × 0.25) + (Experience × 0.1)

2. RESPONSE QUALITY ASSESSMENT: For each answer, evaluate:
   - Accuracy: Is the information technically correct?
   - Depth: Does the response show deep understanding or surface-level knowledge?
   - Clarity: Can the explanation be easily understood?
   - Relevance: Does the answer directly address the question?
   - Examples: Are concrete, relevant examples provided?
   - 60-69: Limited problem-solving ability with inconsistent logic
   - 50-59: Poor logical reasoning with confused problem-solving approach
   - Below 50: No clear problem-solving methodology demonstrated

   Experience & Examples (10% weight):
   - 90-100: Rich, detailed examples demonstrating extensive hands-on experience
   - 80-89: Good practical examples with adequate detail and relevance
   - 70-79: Some relevant examples but lacking comprehensive detail
   - 60-69: Few or weak examples with limited practical experience shown
   - 50-59: Poor or irrelevant examples provided
   - Below 50: No meaningful practical examples given

2. EVIDENCE-BASED ASSESSMENT: Each score must be supported by specific response evidence

3. CONTEXTUAL NAMING: Generate a specific, descriptive interview name based on actual topics discussed:
   - Focus on main technologies and concepts covered
   - Include specific areas like "React Component Architecture", "Database Design & Optimization", "API Development & Security"
   - Examples: "React State Management Deep Dive", "Node.js Authentication Implementation", "Full-Stack Data Architecture"

4. COMPREHENSIVE TECH EXTRACTION: Extract ALL technologies mentioned, including:
   - Programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)
   - Frameworks and libraries (React, Vue, Express, Django, etc.)
   - Databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
   - Tools and platforms (Docker, AWS, Git, VS Code, Node.js, etc.)
   - Concepts and methodologies (REST API, GraphQL, Microservices, etc.)
   
   IMPORTANT: If NO specific technologies are mentioned in the transcript, return an empty array for extractedTechStack.
   Do NOT include technologies from the original tech stack unless they were actually discussed.

Please provide your evaluation in this JSON format:

  }
}

SCORING RATIONALE: For each category score, provide specific reasoning:
- What specific responses or behaviors led to this score?
- Which answers were strong/weak and why?
- What evidence supports this assessment?

IMPORTANT: Base scores STRICTLY on actual response quality and demonstrated competence. Use conservative scoring - only exceptional responses should score 85+. Typical good responses should score in the 70s. Poor or vague responses should receive scores in the 50s-60s. Provide specific reasoning for each score.
