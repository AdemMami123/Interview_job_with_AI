ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. STRUCTURED COMPETENCY ASSESSMENT: Evaluate responses using clear criteria:

   Technical Knowledge (40% weight):
   - 90-100: Expert mastery, advanced concepts explained accurately with depth
   - 80-89: Strong technical foundation, correct and comprehensive understanding
   - 70-79: Adequate knowledge with minor gaps, generally sound understanding
   - 60-69: Basic knowledge with notable gaps or inaccuracies
   - 50-59: Limited understanding, significant errors or confusion
   - Below 50: Major technical deficiencies, fundamentally incorrect responses

   Communication Skills (25% weight):
   - 90-100: Exceptionally articulate, clear structure, excellent presentation
   - 80-89: Clear and well-organized communication
   - 70-79: Generally clear with minor issues in organization or clarity
   - 60-69: Somewhat unclear or poorly structured responses
   - 50-59: Difficult to follow, poor communication skills
   - Below 50: Very unclear or incoherent communication

   Problem Solving (25% weight):
   - 90-100: Systematic, methodical approach with excellent logical reasoning
   - 80-89: Good problem-solving methodology and logical thinking
   - 70-79: Basic problem-solving skills with some logical structure
   - 60-69: Limited problem-solving ability, inconsistent logic
   - 50-59: Poor logical reasoning, confused problem-solving approach
   - Below 50: No clear problem-solving methodology demonstrated

   Experience & Engagement (10% weight):
   - 90-100: Rich examples, high engagement, demonstrates extensive experience
   - 80-89: Good examples and engagement level
   - 70-79: Some relevant examples, adequate engagement
   - 60-69: Limited examples, moderate engagement
   - 50-59: Few or weak examples, low engagement
   - Below 50: No meaningful examples, poor engagement

2. LEVEL-BASED EXPECTATIONS: Calibrate scoring based on template level (${templateData.level})
3. EVIDENCE-BASED SCORING: Each score must be supported by specific response evidence

2. CONTEXTUAL NAMING: Generate a specific, descriptive assessment title based on actual topics discussed:
   - Focus on main technologies and concepts covered
   - Include specific areas like "React Component Design", "Database Optimization", "System Architecture"
   - Examples: "React State Management Assessment", "Node.js API Development Evaluation", "Full-Stack Architecture Review"

3. TECH EXTRACTION: Extract ALL technologies mentioned during the conversation:
   - Programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.)
   - Frameworks and libraries (React, Vue, Express, Django, etc.)
   - Databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
   - Tools and platforms (Docker, AWS, Git, VS Code, etc.)
   - Concepts and methodologies (REST API, GraphQL, Microservices, etc.)

Please provide your evaluation in this JSON format:

IMPORTANT: Base scores STRICTLY on actual response quality and demonstrated competence. Use conservative scoring - only exceptional responses should score 85+. Typical good responses should score in the 70s. Poor or vague responses should receive scores in the 50s-60s.
